					In proportion to the minimal wage, the prices have gone up signifiacntly and made life harder for some who

					Give helps in aiding those who are in need. The purspose of this website is to mediate between people who are
					willing to donate and the ones who are willing to receive. Various resources, such as books, fabric materials,
					clothes do not need to be thrown away the moment you don't need them. They can be passed to someone else. Did
